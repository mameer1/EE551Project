# EE551Project
Final project for EE551

For my final project, I will be creating an original Python based game called Tower of Perdition which will consist of at least 10 levels (and maybe some secret levels...) where the user will be climbing up a fictitious tower fighting any enemies along the way or solving puzzles to advance to the next floor. The game will end once the user conquers the final challenge at the top of the tower.

This game will utilize functions, classes, math, and random events to simulate the experience that the user will go through, and the user will have to make life-risking choices along the way. The user will interact with the program through a menu interface with a list of choices to choose from. It is their choices that will determine their fate in the tower. The program will terminate if the user makes poor decisions leading to their demise.
